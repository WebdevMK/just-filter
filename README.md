# just-filter

Improve the default filtering and sorting on Just Eat UK restaurants results pages

Chrome Extension:

It improves the way the default Just-Eat.co.uk filtering and sorting options work.

It allows you to select multiple cuisines and types of dishes.

It also adds several new filters:

- Open
- Preorder
- Minimum order 0-10 GBP
- Free delivery
- Rating min. 4/6
- Promotion

Now all options are applied in a second - there's no page reload!

The extension's functionality can be easily turned off by a handy switch, available by clicking on the 'JE' extension icon.

The extension does not collect any sort of data nor private information.
Also, the code is Open-Source for you to check/contribute.
